# Daniel-Nelson-Professional-Developer-Page

## Description

In this project I created the landing page for my future professional developer website. My goal was to create an easily navigated, visually appealing page that clearly linked to future projects and followed industry best practices.

The primary problems that I solved were manipulating CSS to arrive at the layout and page architecture I desired. My instructor advised me to seek to develop my own "voice" through viewing this project as not only a technical act, but also a creative one. To achieve my goals I had to experiment with new CSS techniques (especially Flexbox and adaptive media query style sheets) and to adhere to best practices with semantic elementation and informative commenting.
